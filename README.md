## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

### What I learned

I am most proud of creating a responsive design that works well across different screen sizes, as well as ensuring that the hover and focus states are properly implemented. I also made an effort to improve accessibility by following best practices in HTML and CSS. However, next time, I would like to implement the bonus features, such as saving the game state upon refresh and improving the CPU's logic to not only block my winning moves but also make strategic decisions to win. I plan to build a future version of this project using React to achieve these goals.

The main challenge I faced was managing the JavaScript logic, especially defining and updating different states of the game. I had to ensure that the game flow worked correctly depending on whether the user was playing against the CPU or in multiplayer mode. It was also essential to handle resetting the game, moving to the next round, and updating the game statistics. Additionally, incorporating features for screen readers required careful attention. To overcome these challenges, I did a lot of research and received significant help from ChatGPT. Although I tried to solve most problems on my own, I reached out for guidance when I got stuck.

### Continued development

For the next time If I wanna do this project again, I will first use a Js framework like react and also do the bonus goals of the project.
